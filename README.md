# Net-Promoter-Score-2.0

The Net Promoter Score was created by Bain & Co's Fred Reichheld as a metric to gauge customer satisifaction and debuted in Harvard Business Review's 2003 article "One Number You Need to Grow”. Its alleged correlation with net inncome has earned management's ear, witnessing a 500% increase in mentions over the past 5 years on S&P 500 companies earnings calls (WSJ).

Although rising in popularity, Net Promoter Scores still rely on traditional surveys, subjecting them to unnecessary associated biases. Online reviews, on the other hand, are more accessible and improve accuracy through sample size and purchase verification. This project strived to improve Net Promoter Scores by employing Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to gauge customer satisfaction from the Amazon Reviews data set.
