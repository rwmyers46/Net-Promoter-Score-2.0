Although rising in popularity, Net Promoter Scores still rely on traditional surveys, subjecting them to selection biases. Conversely, online reviews inherently increase accuracy by providing both purchase verification and vastly larger sample sizes. This project strived to improve Net Promoter Scores by employing Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to gauge customer satisfaction from the [Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).
