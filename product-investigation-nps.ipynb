This process provides managers with higher fidelity information about the online market's sentiment for a product with specific justifications, allowing for more timely, accurate business decisions. \n",

      "Review: By satisfying people around the world with convenient bluetooth speakers, we would like to introduce the DKnight MagicBox, a portable and easy to use speaker. The product includes enhanced bass, a built in microphone for phone calls, and 10W Output Power. Its bluetooth is able to be compatible with many types of bluetooth-enabled devices. It also contains a built-in 2000mA rechargable battery that may last you for a long time whenever you're at various destinations. The Magicbox can be carried around for personal use or at a party. Its wireless range is up to 33 ft, so you are capable of being in charge with its controls no matter where you go. The package comes with a 3.5 mm aux cable for those devices who don't support bluetooth.The DKnight Magicbox is a great speaker for parties or just listening to loud music in general.<br /> I've been using the Dknight MagicBox for about 3 weeks and it has been a very good speaker to me. The sound is great,with loud volume when in a quiet place, and its bass is pretty impressive for a small speaker. Sometimes it disconnects from my device and then reconnects and the actual speaker doesn't look like the picture above. However, it does its job as a speaker and I really enjoyed its company. Its structure is simple and small and I would recommend this product to anyone with a budget to buy the DKnight MagicBox.\n",

      "Review: This speaker is absolutely amazing in itself, but the price makes it an irresistible product. I bought one to have a portable speaker for playing music outside and for our kids to play their bedtime music when traveling. The sound is  awesome, it has controls to adjust the volume as needed, and it's size is decent. The sound can easily be heard from 50 ft away and is far more than we expected for sound quality. We've actually purchased a couple more since to give as gifts. Absolutely a great buy!\n",

      "Review: Darn thing works too good. Bought this as a gift for our 15-year-old.  I did not think it would perform or sound as good as it does.  I did not expect much given its moderate price.  But it really puts out the sound, much to my chagrin. Our son plays it in the bathroom while he is showering and we can clearly hear it over the shower and his 15-year-old singing and shower sounds.  When I am able to get over the volume, the sound quality is pretty good too, although I still don't understand any of his music.  Still trying to figure out what &#34;back it up&#34; means.  I am pretty sure it is not a driving maneuver.\n"

      "Review: Darn thing works too good. Bought this as a gift for our 15-year-old.  I did not think it would perform or sound as good as it does.  I did not expect much given its moderate price.  But it really puts out the sound, much to my chagrin. Our son plays it in the bathroom while he is showering and we can clearly hear it over the shower and his 15-year-old singing and shower sounds.  When I am able to get over the volume, the sound quality is pretty good too, although I still don't understand any of his music.  Still trying to figure out what &#34;back it up&#34; means.  I am pretty sure it is not a driving maneuver.\n",

      "Review: This speaker is absolutely amazing in itself, but the price makes it an irresistible product. I bought one to have a portable speaker for playing music outside and for our kids to play their bedtime music when traveling. The sound is  awesome, it has controls to adjust the volume as needed, and it's size is decent. The sound can easily be heard from 50 ft away and is far more than we expected for sound quality. We've actually purchased a couple more since to give as gifts. Absolutely a great buy!\n",

      "Review: By satisfying people around the world with convenient bluetooth speakers, we would like to introduce the DKnight MagicBox, a portable and easy to use speaker. The product includes enhanced bass, a built in microphone for phone calls, and 10W Output Power. Its bluetooth is able to be compatible with many types of bluetooth-enabled devices. It also contains a built-in 2000mA rechargable battery that may last you for a long time whenever you're at various destinations. The Magicbox can be carried around for personal use or at a party. Its wireless range is up to 33 ft, so you are capable of being in charge with its controls no matter where you go. The package comes with a 3.5 mm aux cable for those devices who don't support bluetooth.The DKnight Magicbox is a great speaker for parties or just listening to loud music in general.<br /> I've been using the Dknight MagicBox for about 3 weeks and it has been a very good speaker to me. The sound is great,with loud volume when in a quiet place, and its bass is pretty impressive for a small speaker. Sometimes it disconnects from my device and then reconnects and the actual speaker doesn't look like the picture above. However, it does its job as a speaker and I really enjoyed its company. Its structure is simple and small and I would recommend this product to anyone with a budget to buy the DKnight MagicBox.\n"
